# Q1 tinytroupe Installation & Setup Guide

This guide will walk you through installing and configuring the tinytroupe package in a GitHub Codespace environment.

## üì¶ Step 1: Install Packages

1. *Open a terminal* in your GitHub Codespace.

2. *Clone the repository*:
   bash
   git clone https://github.com/microsoft/tinytroupe
   

3. *Navigate to the project folder*:
   bash
   cd tinytroupe
   

4. *Install the package*:
   bash
   pip install .

## üîê Step 2: Setup OpenAI API Key

1. In the same terminal, set your OpenAI API Key:
   bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-key-here"
   

2. (Optional) To make the API key persist between sessions, add the following line to your shell configuration file (e.g., ~/.bashrc, ~/.zshrc, or ~/.profile):

   bash
   echo 'export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-key-here"' >> ~/.bashrc
   source ~/.bashrc
   

3. Verify the key is set:
   bash
   echo $OPENAI_API_KEY

## ‚úÖ You're Ready!

Once setup is complete, you can begin using the tinytroupe framework to simulate multi-agent LLM interactions.

# Q2  What is Turing Test? In today's world with Large Language Models (LLMs), what is the definition of Turing Test?
The Turing Test was proposed in 1950 by Alan Turing, a pioneer of computer science. The goal of the test is to assess a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior indistinguishable from that of a human.
In the Original Setup:
‚Ä¢	A human judge interacts with a machine and a human.
‚Ä¢	If the judge cannot reliably tell which is the machine, then the machine is said to have passed the Turing Test.
Today, the Turing Test has evolved beyond the basic ‚ÄúCan it fool a judge?‚Äù setup.
Modern Interpretation with LLMs:
‚Ä¢	Focuses on contextual coherence, empathy, humor, common sense reasoning, and factual correctness.
‚Ä¢	A new benchmark includes not just fooling a human, but also sustaining meaningful, goal-oriented, error-free dialogue.
‚Ä¢	There's growing debate on whether just being convincing is enough ‚Äî especially with LLMs like GPT-4 passing casual Turing Tests easily.
